Eden AI is an intelligent wellness platform that helps users detect burnout and discover personalized recovery getaways. Using behavioral and contextual data — like calendar activity, work hours, and lifestyle trends — the AI curates restful trips designed to restore work–life balance. Each recommendation highlights destinations focused on mindfulness, nature, or digital detox experiences, paired with dynamic pricing and wellness tags.
Built with React, Firebase, and OpenAI/Gemini APIs, Eden AI blends emotional intelligence with modern design to make well-being actionable. It’s not just a travel app — it’s an AI companion that reminds you when to pause, recharge, and rediscover balance.
